# Experimental Results

This directory contains the results of the experiments on the three adopted NMT models: CodeBERT, CodeT5+ and Seq2Seq.

Each directory contains 25 sub-folders, one for the baseline experiment, i.e., without any data poisoning, and 24 experiments for each combination of vulnerability category (ICI, DPI, TPI) and poisoning rate (ranging between 5 and 40, with a 5 samples step).

The results of each experiment comprise: 
* a ``python_test_gold`` file, containing the ground-truth code snippets of the test set;
* a ``python_test_output`` file, containing the code snippets generated by the NMT model when fed the intents in the test set;
* a logfile reporting the outcome of the training process and the results of the experiment in terms of textual similarity metrics, including BLEU-n score (n between 1 and 4), Exact Match (EM), Edit Distance (ED), METEOR, ROUGE-n score (n between 1 and 4) and ROUGE-L metric.
